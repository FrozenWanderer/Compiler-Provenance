Compiler Provenance Attribution using Machine Learning: This project explores the application of machine learning techniques for compiler provenance attribution. It aims to identify compilers and their optimization levels from binary structures. Utilizing a set of ML models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, the project demonstrates significant prowess in compiler detection. Grounded in feature engineering methods and utilizing the BinComp dataset
